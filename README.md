# FigcaptionExtractor

## Overview
FigcaptionExtractor is a simple tool designed to extract figcaptions from HTML files. This can be useful for tasks that involve processing and analyzing image captions from web pages.

## Files
extractor.py: The main Python script that performs the extraction of figcaptions from HTML files.
test.html: A sample HTML file to test the functionality of the extractor.
captions.txt: The output file where the extracted captions are stored.

## Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the extractor.py script using the command:
```
py extractor.py
```
The script will read the test.html file and extract all figcaptions, saving them to captions.txt.

## Example
To see the tool in action, run the extractor.py script. The captions.txt file will be created with the extracted figcaptions from the test.html file.
